### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I became familiar with the event listener function and that the parameter is "click" so that when the user clicks on the button on the program it will animate.)
2. (I learned that jquery has a css function built-in, so that you can change the color schemes in the file from yellow to blue and the progrmam knows what that is instead of having to type the hexadecimal equivalent such as #FFFF00 which is yellow.)
3. (I didn't really know what the hover function would do but after completing the code for the assignment I know what it does. It basically previews the items under it when the user moves the mouse over the header then hides it when the mouse is no longer on the header.)
